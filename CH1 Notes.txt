Here you see another feature of the .NET Framework. You can use the Thread.CurrentThread
class to ask for information about the thread that’s executing. This is called the
thread’s *execution context*

If you want to use local data in a thread and initialize it for each thread, you can use the
ThreadLocal<T> class.

A thread’s current culture (a CultureInfo associated with the current thread that is used to format dates,
times, numbers, currency values, the sorting order of text, casing conventions, and string
comparisons), principal (representing the current security context), priority (a value to indicate
how the thread should be scheduled by the operating system), and other info.
